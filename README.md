# TuneHealth

This project is an Expo based mobile and web application for playing relaxing tones. Users can pick a tone and play/stop it on demand. The same code runs on iOS, Android and the web via Expo.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Install dependencies (if they aren't already checked in):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Expo server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Running `npm test` executes Jest with `--passWithNoTests`.
